Real-Time Healthcare Data Processing with Delta Live Tables (DLT)

This repository contains a real-time data processing pipeline for healthcare data using Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Databricks. The project demonstrates how to build a scalable and efficient ETL pipeline that leverages Databricksâ€™ advanced features for data processing and transformation.

## Tech Stack

- **PySpark**
- **Databricks**
- **Delta Tables**
- **Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) Workflow**

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to implement a real-time data processing pipeline that efficiently handles healthcare data using Delta Live Tables. The pipeline processes data through multiple stages to ensure high quality and readiness for analytics.

### Key Features

- **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**: Uses DLT for managing and automating the data transformation process.
- **Data Stages**: Includes Bronze, Silver, and Gold stages to refine data quality.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Integrates and processes real-time patient data.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time healthcare data is ingested into the source raw Delta table.
2. **Data Transformation**: A PySpark notebook processes the raw data, creating Bronze, Silver, and Gold Delta Live Tables.
3. **Workflow Automation**: A Delta Live Table Workflow manages and automates the data transformation process.
